# How to get tokens on Testnet

Issue tokens to your account in Testnet blockchain using the Ultra faucet tool [Ultra Testnet Tools](https://faucet.testnet.app.ultra.io/). In the Ultra Wallet, the "Buy UOS" button also redirects to this tool.

Once you open the Faucet, you have to copy/paste your blockchain account, pass the captcha quiz and click the button “Issue”. Remember this tool is working only with Ultra Testnet blockchain.
