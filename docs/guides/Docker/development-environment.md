# Development Environment Setup

Most convinent way to interact with a docker container and manage the files inside it is by using VSCode

## Local

For the local environment you just open `~/ultra_workdir` if you're on Linux or `C:\Users\Username\ultra_workdir` on Windows using VSCode. You can write all the tests and smart contract code locally. Then if you want to build and test use one of the following pathways:
- [VSCode extension](../../tools/smart-contract-toolkit/index.md)
- [Run build commands in docker](./docker-contract-development-flow.md)

## Docker

Run the [docker start command](./docker-image-usage.md#running-the-image).
It'll start a container called `ultra` to which you can connect using VSCode.
By default your `ultra-workdir` is mounted to the `/opt/ultra_workdir` directory inside
the container so any changes in that directory will persist on your filesystem.
Go to the `Remote-Explorer` and attach to the `ultra` container.

Once connected to the container open the terminal

and open the `/opt/ultra_workdir` directory inside the container

## VPS

To connect to your virtual machine using ssh go to `Remote-Explorer` and then select `SSH Targets`. Make sure the targets are available in your `~/.ssh/config`.
