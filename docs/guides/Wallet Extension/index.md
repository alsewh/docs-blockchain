# Ultra Wallet Browser Extension

![](/images/uwax_main.png)

The Ultra Wallet browser extension is a crypto wallet that allows you to access decentralized applications on Ultra's blockchain and securely manage your digital assets.

The principal functions are to create and manage private keys on behalf of its users, to manage the connections between the wallet and web applications, and allow users to securely sign transactions.

To interact with the wallet, the wallet injects an object named `ultra` into the javascript context of every site. This object contains all the methods required to obtain the user's blockchain id, their public key, and to sign blockchain transactions.
